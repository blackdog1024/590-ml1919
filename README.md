HW1.1:The weight_isadult model seems sometimes not work well.Maybe should try some times.I don't know if the parameters influence it.But seems I haven't got perfect parameters.

HW2.1:The algorithms and methods can be changed in line214-220 in REGRESSION.py

Hw2.2:filename and method can be changed in line 20-21 in HW2.2.1.py.

HW4.0:
1.The dataset is too large so that I can't upload, please names it as "dogs_and_cats" and put it in folder HW4.0, then use the ln link like "ln -s /Users/blackdog/PycharmProjects/pythonProject/homework/HW4.0/ ./" to link to HW4.0. For part2 of the homework, please first run convnet.py then other files.

2.The models generated are also too large, so I compressed them to zip. Please uncompressed them if you need use the models.

3.For data augmentation in part1, I don't know why sometimes it get a good result and sometimes bad, so I put 2 screenshoots that I get a good result in folder MNIST called 'data_augmentation_acc' and 'data_augmentation_acc_loss'
